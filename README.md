# Real Estate Image Classification

Real estate business is growing faster in many countries. Real estate agents deal with millions of customers for buying and selling new as well as old properties. If any customer is approaching a real estate agent for property dealing, the first thing the agent needs to provide the customer is property images. A good picture is worth a thousand wordsâ€™ and in fact, good pictures do help to sell a house. There can be multiple images of properties like Bedroom, Living Room, Kitchen, Backyard, Front yard and Bathroom. These images for showcasing to customers, for each of the property with image name are easy if the properties are in small numbers. As a business growing agent has to deal with thousands of images to segregate and annotate. Segregating and labeling the images for each property now becoming cumbersome and tedious process. Here Real Estate Image Classification mechanism comes to agents' rescue for labeling the images. It helps agents to classify images and labeling these images without wasting much time. This is multiclass classification problem with six classes.
Objective: Correctly classifying images with respective classes with high accuracy.
